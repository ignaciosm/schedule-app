## An employee scheduling tool for my wife
My wife was given a spreadsheet to create her employees' schedule from week to week. She has another spreadsheet to keep up with their availability. This seems pretty archaic and can be a pain when balancing 18 employees (thankfully it's not more).

I looked around at other scheduling tools and could not find a free one that fit the bill. So I decided to make her one.

## Goal of this app
The goal is to make one that is as easy as possible to schedule employees based on set shifts and without scheduling an employee at a time they are not available. If an employee can't work a shift, they won't be able to be assigned that shift. An employees' availability should be adjustable on a week to week basis. If an employee says I won't be able to work on this day two weeks from now, you should be able to go to that week's availability and adjust.

The goal is to make my wife's life easier. At the same time, I want to design it in such a way that it could be used by other managers or companies if it came to that.

## Thinking out loud
The document thinking out loud is where I will do much of my planning and deciding on the structure of the app.
