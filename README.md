## An employee scheduling tool for my wife
My wife was given a spreadsheet to create her employees' schedule from week to week. She has another spreadsheet to keep up with their availability. This seems pretty archaic and can be a pain when balancing 18 employees (thankfully it's not more).

I looked around at other scheduling tools and could not find a free one that fit the bill. So I decided to make her one.

## Goal of this app
The goal is to make one that is as easy as possible to schedule employees based on set shifts and without scheduling an employee at a time they are not available.

The goal is to make my wife's life easier. At the same time, I want to design it in such a way that it could be used by the other managers in her company.
